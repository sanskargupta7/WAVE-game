# About “WAVE” : 
This is a never-ending game depending upon your smartness which gets only more and more difficult in the form of increasing speed.
The main character is a white coloured block which is trying not to get in touch with four types of different blocks which are
red, yellow, green and cyan in colour. The all-time motive of these blocks is to destroy the white block by reducing its energy 
and make it null. All these enemies of white block move randomly over the window the game in variable or constant speed depending 
upon the type of enemy. All these enemies leave a trail behind when they move randomly on the screen. This trail is not harmful but makes the screen look attractive. 
The white block is handled by using W, A, S, D KEYS to move the block in each direction.
It is a complete game in itself with two levels-
1-NORMAL
2-HARD
<ins>BASIC ENEMY</ins>-->It is present in NORMAL mode of the game only. This enemy has random spawning, it can be generated from anywhere. Its velocity is constant of 5 units.
<ins>HARD ENEMY</ins>-->This enemy is present in HARD mode only and is a little difficult to avoid. Its speed is variable and keeps changing every time it touches the wall.
<ins>FAST ENEMY</ins>--> This enemy is present in both the modes of the game. Its speed is more than the others
<ins>SMART ENEMY</ins>-->This enemy only follows the white block wherever it goes. Its speed is very less than the others but it is very dangerous because it only looks for the players block only.

The game can be paused in between using 'P KEY'

Each time the players block comes in boundary of the enemy, its energy is reduced 20 units of the present total energy. The longer you 
survive, the more your score increases. Each time your score increases by 250, a new enemy is spawned.
You can also increase your energy by some amount by buying it from the shop at the cost of your scores. The shop window is opened when the player press 'SPACEBAR KEY'. From the shop you can upgrade health, upgrade speed and refill your health.
When the score reaches <ins>2500</ins>, a new red coloured object (BOSS) enters the arena who also attacks the players block with red coloured 
projectiles which reduce the energy bar of the block. It only moves in x-axis and every time it collides with the wall its speed increases.
Now your aim is to not let yourself touch with these projectiles. You can survive in this game as long as your energy is there in the bar.
